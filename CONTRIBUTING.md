If you have any issues or ideas for improvement you can send me an email to _thl-cmk[at]outlook[dot]com_.

For some fixes/improvements I migth need the raw output of the logpresso scanner.


If you have any issues with the package please put the following information in your email:

- version/edition of check_mk you are using
- version/platform of the target ptalform
- version/edition of the logpresso scanner
- raw output from the logpresso scanner
- check_mk_agent output from the cve_2021_44228_log4j plugin (starting with `<<<cve_2021_44228_log4j:sep(0)>>>`)
- the crash report from cchek_mk if any
